Get the Mask, Subnet, Min, and Max of ip:192.168.204.197 /26

1. Convert ip address to binary and get the mask
2. All binary numbers in ip address and subnet mask calculate it all.
  (all the 1 are equal to 1 and all that have a 0 are equal to 0 even it is have 1)
3. Find the host range. compare the mask and ip address into bitwise.
4. The total of all the number of subnet and hosts per subnet are need to calculate.
